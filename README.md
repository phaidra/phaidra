# About this repository

This repo hosts the source code and the docker-compose startup file of the
[PHAIDRA](https://phaidra.org/) (Permanent Hosting, Archiving and
Indexing of Digital Resources and Assets) software, developed at the
[Vienna University Computer Center](https://zid.univie.ac.at/en/).

The aim of this project is to provide a high-quality, easy-to-set-up
web-based digital archiving system for academic institutions and other
organizations that need to provide a solution for long-term-archiving of
valuable data and metadata about the stored objects.

We provide various flavors for different use cases, from a demo version
running on a local desktop computer for evaluation, to an Shibboleth-enabled
server version.

# Setup
For all versions, you will need a recent [Docker
Installation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/), ideally on a
Linux distribution (PHAIDRA is mainly developed on Ubuntu and Debian).

Assuming you already have a running standard Docker installation you can either
continue that way, as it should not interfere with the code of this
repo.

However, we recommend using docker rootless to stay in sync with
this repo's documentation. There is extensive official [upstream
documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/) on how to
do that.

See section [Docker Notes](#docker-notes) below to see what we do on a typical installation for running PHAIDRA on rootless containers.

# Docker compose profiles

We are using docker profiles to start up the relevant containers for the desired use case.

You can set `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME="PROJECT_NAME_OF_YOUR_LIKING"` in your `.env` or use the `--project-name $PROJECT_NAME_OF_YOUR_LIKING` flag to the `docker compose` command, if you want to change the default project-name `phaidra`. The name will be used in the folder name of your volumes.

## Profiles using versioned images including all code

+ `demo-local`: for an evaluation installation, serving PHAIDRA on `http://localhost:8899`. Uses only local storage.
+ `demo-s3`: for an evaluation installation, serving PHAIDRA on `http://localhost:8899`. Uses an S3-bucket for the object repository and images converted to the format supported by IIPImage.
+ `ssl-local`: for broadcasting/production use, serving PHAIDRA on `https://$YOURDOMAIN`. Uses only local storage.
+ `ssl-s3`: for broadcasting/production use, serving PHAIDRA on `https://$YOURDOMAIN`. Uses an S3-bucket for the object repository and images converted to the format supported by IIPImage.
+ `shib-local`: for broadcasting/production use, serving PHAIDRA on `https://$YOURDOMAIN`. Uses only local storage.  Uses an external shibboleth-idp for authentication.
+ `shib-s3`: for broadcasting/production use, serving PHAIDRA on `https://$YOURDOMAIN`. Uses an S3-bucket for the object repository and images converted to the format supported by IIPImage.  Uses an external shibboleth-idp for authentication.

## Profiles bindmounting the repository's code

+ `demo-local-dev`: see above.
+ `demo-s3-dev`: see above.
+ `ssl-local-dev`: see above.
+ `ssl-s3-dev`: see above.
+ `shib-local-dev`: see above.
+ `shib-s3-dev`: see above.

Additionally to the bind mounted code, the ui components phaidra-ui and phaidra-vue-components directories will be watched and the Nuxt app will be started in hotreload. Changes to the source code should then be recompiled and applied on save. To start the container in watch mode you can use the --watch parameter.

Note: Running the Nuxt application in hotreload requires a lot of memory and can occasionally lead to a crash when it reaches the heap limit.

# Run it
All default values assume that you are running docker rootless as the first non-root user with uid 1000 on your Linux computer. This is what we strongly recommend. However, if this does not match your reality, please check the following options:
## Linux user on docker rootless, but not uid 1000
+ Please set the variable `HOST_DOCKER_SOCKET` to `/run/user/$YOUR-UID/docker.sock` in an `.env` file.  You can get your uid quickly by running `id -u`.
## Users running privileged ('normal') docker (Linux and Windows Docker based on wsl2)
+ Please set the variable `ADMIN_IP_LIST` to `172.29.5.1` in an `.env` file for the demo/localhost version. This is to reach the admin area. For ssl/shib see below.
+ Please set the variable `HOST_DOCKER_SOCKET` to `/var/run/docker.sock` in an `.env` file. This is to get proper service monitoring.
## Users running privileged ('normal') docker (OSX)
+ Please set the variable `ADMIN_IP_LIST` to `192.168.65.1` in an `.env` file for the demo/localhost version. This is to reach the admin area. For ssl/shib see below.
+ Please set the variable `HOST_DOCKER_SOCKET` to `/var/run/docker.sock` in an `.env` file. This is to get proper service monitoring.

## Demo version with local storage

```

## Shibboleth version with local storage
NOTE: This profile is not as straightforward, as the built-in apache2 webserver will act as a Shibboleth-SP, which requires registration at your organization's Shibboleth IDP. It's very likely that you need to modify a row of variables, depending on your organization.
###  Prerequisites
+ make sure no other service is using ports 80 and 443 on your computer.
+ a DNS-entry pointing to your computer's IP-address.
+ SSL-certificate and -key (put them into the `certs/httpd` and name them `privkey.pem` and `fullchain.pem` -- **make sure your user has read access on these files**).  Certificates acquired from the [certbot tool](https://certbot.eff.org/) should do the job as they contain the full chain of certificates.
+ generate certificates for communication with your idp by running the commands below and put them into `certs/shibboleth`:
```
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout sp-encrypt-key.pem -days $DESIRED_VALIDITY_TIME -subj '/CN=$YOUR_FQDN' -out sp-encrypt-cert.pem
openssl req -new -x509 -nodes -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout sp-signing-key.pem -days $DESIRED_VALIDITY_TIME -subj '/CN=$YOUR_FQDN' -out sp-signing-cert.pem
```
+ firewall with ports 80 and 443 open on your computer.
+ set the following variables in your `.env` file:
  + `ADMIN_IP_LIST`: List of space-delimited IP addresses that should be allowed to reach the admin area. This includes the static IP address of your computer if you access the installation through your local browser. If you access your installation from localhost by modifying `/etc/hosts` you will want to keep the gateway address in there as well (10.0.2.2 [default] for rootless docker on Linux, 172.29.5.1 for privileged docker on Linux or Windows,  192.168.65.1 for privileged docker on OSX).

  + `PHAIDRA_HOSTPORT=""`
  + `PHAIDRA_PORTSTUB=""`
  + `PHAIDRA_HOSTNAME="$YOUR-FQDN"`
  + `SHIB_DISCO_URL`: shibboleth discovery URL.
  + `SHIB_METADATA_CERT`: shibboleth metadata signing certificate.
  + `SHIB_METADATA_FILE`: shibboleth metadata file.
  + `SHIB_METADATA`: shibboleth metadata file url.

  + `MD_CERTIFICATE_AGREEMENT`

###  Startup

Run the following command to get PHAIDRA running on `https://$YOUR-FQDN`:

```
docker compose --profile shib-local up -d
```

After startup, download your SP's Metadata file by visiting `https://$YOUR-FQDN/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata`. You will have to hand this file to the IDP-manager of your organization and ask for registration.  After that, users matching the list in `SHIB_REQUIRED_AFFILIATIONS` should be able to log in and upload their files to your system.

## Shibboleth version with S3 storage
NOTE: This profile is not as straight forward, as the built-in apache2 webserver will act as a Shibboleth-SP, which requires registration at your organization's Shibboleth IDP. It's very likely that you need to modify a row of variables, depending on your organization.

  + `MD_CERTIFICATE_AGREEMENT`

###  Startup

Run the following command to get PHAIDRA running on `https://$YOUR-FQDN`:

```
docker compose --profile shib-s3 up -d
```

After startup, download your SP's Metadata file by visiting `https://$YOUR-FQDN/Shibboleth.sso/Metadata`. You will have to hand this file to the IDP-manager of your organization and ask for registration. After that, users matching the list in `SHIB_REQUIRED_AFFILIATIONS` should be able to log in and upload their files to your system.

# Version update
If you have a previous version running, check CHANGELOG.pm for changes and update instructions. The normal procedure is:
* compose down
* pull latest version of this repository
* compose up
Some versions might require the execution of a migration script, but this will be mentioned in the changelog.

# ACME
Phaidra supports ACME in the \*ssl\* and \*shib\* profiles. To enable it, the following ENV variables need to be set:
+ `CA_ENDPOINT`: ACME endpoint you want to use. Defaults to LetsEncrypt staging, i.e. the certificates you get won't be production-ready!
+ `MD_CERTIFICATE_AGREEMENT`: set to `accepted` if you accept the TOS of your CA.
+ `PHAIDRA_ADMIN_EMAIL`: Must be set to a valid email address. The ACME client uses this as contact address.

Additionally the MDStoreDir and MDomain stanzas in `configs/httpd_tls.conf` must be uncommented.

In case you want to use an ACME endpoint requiring authentication ("External Account Binding"), you must set it manually in the docker config `configs/httpd_tls.conf`.

After starting the containers, the mod_md will fetch the certificates, but a (graceful) restart is needed for apache to start using them. You can simply restart the httpd container using `docker restart <containe_id>`

# Extra profiles
## minio
+ `minio-s3-dev`: Local Minio S3 instance. Combine with \*-s3-\* profile if you don't have an S3 instance at hand. With default S3_\* ENV variables (i.e. none set), no further configuration is required. Do not use this in production! The admin UI is available under localhost:9001 with `$S3_ACCESS_KEY` and `$S3_SECRET_KEY` as username/password. Default to `phaidra` and `phaidraphaidra`.
## Standalone
+ `website`: For convenient development of our website at [www.phaidra.org](https://www.phaidra.org).
   This profile can be activated by running `docker compose --profile website up -d`.  You will have a hot-reloading version of our website at `http://localhost:8000` which is controlled by `mkdocs.yaml` and renders the pages under `website`.
## Add-On
+ `external-opencast`: can be added to any of the profiles that use local storage, if an external opencast-streaming-server is available to you. Uses a versioned image including all code. It can be started up with a command like: `docker compose --profile ssl-local --profile external-opencast up -d`.  An additional container (`vige`) will be started up.  This container uploads videos to the external opencast instance, monitors conversion status and retrieves the resulting link.  Usage of an external opencast server is highly recommended to reduce IO stress and bandwidth usage.

  The following variables will have to be set:
  + `OC_EXTERNAL="ACTIVATED"`
  + `OC_USER`
  + `OC_PASS`
  + `OC_EVENTS_URL`
  + `OC_INGEST_URL`

+ `external-opencast-dev`: can be added to any of the dev-profiles that use local storage, if an external opencast-streaming-server is available to you. Uses bindmounted code from the repository. It can be started up with a command like: `docker compose --profile ssl-local-dev --profile external-opencast-dev up -d`.  An additional container (`vige`) will be started up.  This container uploads videos to the external opencast instance, monitors conversion status and retrieves the resulting link.  Usage of an external opencast server is highly recommended to reduce IO stress and bandwidth usage.
    The following variables will have to be set:
  + `OC_EXTERNAL="ACTIVATED"`
  + `OC_USER`
  + `OC_PASS`
  + `OC_EVENTS_URL`
  + `OC_INGEST_URL`


# Default credentials on administration sites
- **LDAP Account Manager** (from the Web interface: Manage Phaidra -> Manage Users):
  - user: `admin`
  - password: `adminpassword`.
  These credentials can be altered at first startup through the variables `LDAP_ADMIN_USERNAME` and `LDAP_ADMIN_PASSWORD` at first startup in your `.env` file.
    - There are three default users built in for testing purposes (logging into Phaidra, uploading, etc) `pone`, `ptwo`, and `barchiver`.  They all share the same password `1234`.
    - These users can be accessed/altered/deleted from **LDAP Account manager**.
- **Fedora** (from the Web interface: Manage Phaidra -> Inspect Object Repository):
  - username: `fedoraAdmin`
  - password: `1234`
  - These credentials can be altered in the `.env` file through the variables `FEDORA_ADMIN_USER` and `FEDORA_ADMIN_PASS`.
- **Grafana** (from the Web interface: Manage Phaidra -> Inspect Running Services):
  - username: `phaidra`
  - password: `phaidra`
  - These credentials can be altered at first startup in the `.env` file through the variables `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_USER` and `GF_SECURITY_ADMIN_PASS`.
- **DbGate** (from the Web interface: Manage Phaidra -> Inspect Databases)
  - username: `phaidra`
  - password: `phaidra`
  - Here only the password can be modified in the `.env` file through the variable `DBGATE_PASS`.  If you want to change the username as well, please change it in the `docker-compose.yaml` file in the `dbgate:` section.  The corresponding variable is called `LOGINS`. You will have to put the username into the variable in the next line `LOGIN_PASSWORD_[username]` as well, that's why we can't centrally manage this from `.env` for now.
- **Solr** (from the Web interface: Manage Phaidra -> Inspect Search Engine)
  - username: `phaidra`
  - password: `phaidra`
  - These credentials can be modified in the `.env` file through the variables `SOLR_USER` and `SOLR_PASS`. You might also want to change `SOLR_SALT` to some random string for a more random encryption of the credentials within solr.
- the **api**
  - username: `phaidraAdmin`
  - password: `12345`
  - These credentials can be modified in the `.env` file through the variables `PHAIDRA_ADMIN_USER` and `PHAIDRA_ADMIN_PASSWORD`.  You might also want to change `PHAIDRA_ENCRYPTION_KEY` and `PHAIDRA_SECRET` to enhance privacy.
# Monitoring PHAIDRA

There is a Grafana dashboard at `http://localhost:8899/grafana`, respectively `https://YOUR_FQDN/grafana`, that displays the containers' system usage and their logs.

One can also use the following shell command to monitor the system usage
of PHAIDRA over all containers from the machine where it is running (here from an instance started with
`docker compose --project-name eval-shib-opencast-3 --profile shib-local --profile external-opencast up -d`):

# Data persistance and integrity
The startup command will create directories in
`$HOME/.local/share/docker/volumes` (`/var/lib/docker/volumes` in case you run rootful docker) to persist data created by PHAIDRA
over docker restarts or whole system reboots.  These directories are the ones that need to be backupped to prevent data loss in case 
of hardware failure.

Objects loaded into PHAIDRA are automatically checksummed using the [SHA512-algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2) by the underlying
repository software [Fedora](https://fedora.lyrasis.org/). By default, PHAIDRA triggers a recalculation of the checksums on every 2nd day of the month.  Results of these scans are visible on the built-in Grafana Dashboard for early hardware failure detection.

See the section [Graphical System overview](#graphical-system-overview) for how these directories are connected to the containers.

# Uninstalling

If you want to uninstall PHAIDRA from your computer, this can be done very easily. See the commands below to reset your system
to a 'clean slate'.

## Shut down running PHAIDRA
Make sure to shut down your running instance.:

## Remove persisted data
The following command will remove the volumes (aka directories under `$HOME/.local/share/docker/volumes`) associated with your PHAIDRA installation. Set the project name filter according to you needs). This command can be run from anywhere.

```
# COMMAND:
docker volume rm $(docker volume ls --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=eval-shib-opencast --quiet)
# EXPECTED OUTPUT:
eval-shib-opencast_chronos-database-dumps
eval-shib-opencast_chronos-oai-logs
eval-shib-opencast_chronos-sitemaps
eval-shib-opencast_dbgate
eval-shib-opencast_fedora
eval-shib-opencast_grafana
eval-shib-opencast_loki
eval-shib-opencast_mariadb_fedora
eval-shib-opencast_mariadb_phaidra
eval-shib-opencast_mongodb_phaidra
eval-shib-opencast_openldap
eval-shib-opencast_pixelgecko
eval-shib-opencast_prometheus
eval-shib-opencast_solr
eval-shib-opencast_vige
eval-shib-opencast_vige-mongosh
```

## Remove docker images built by compose
NOTE: This command is only needed if you use one of the *-dev profiles, which will actually build the user-interface. This command can be run from anywhere.

```
# COMMAND:
docker image rm $(docker image ls --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=$PROJECT_NAME_OF_YOUR_LIKING --quiet)
# EXPECTED OUTPUT (hashes are matter of change):
Untagged: $PROJECT_NAME_OF_YOUR_LIKING-ui:latest
Deleted: sha256:473336b19091df7aec4e549ae0f41ba7cea0147a08e86e335cebe64e88f16812
```

## Clean up Docker caches
In case you are developing and changing a lot of components, dockerfiles and docker-compose files, 
things can become cluttered. To remove everything including build caches, you can run 
 the following command:
```
# COMMAND:
docker system prune --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=$PROJECT_NAME_OF_YOUR_LIKING
# EXPECTED OUTPUT (hashes are matter of change):
WARNING! This will remove:
  - all stopped containers
  - all networks not used by at least one container
  - all dangling images
  - all dangling build cache

  Items to be pruned will be filtered with:
  - label=com.docker.compose.project=phaidra-demo

## Reset a project

To reset (remove volumes and containers) a project:

```bash
# get the variables, imply that `COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME` is set in .env
source .env

# stop project containers
 docker compose stop
# delete containers, volumes cannot be deleted otherwise
 docker rm -vf $(docker ps -a -q --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME)
# delete volumes
 docker volume rm $(docker volume ls -q --filter label=com.docker.compose.project=$COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME)
# Compose the project
 docker compose --profile <your profile> up -d
# Restart the http container if the certificate is managed by MD
 sleep 60
 docker container restart $COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME-httpd-ssl-local-1 
```

As one can see above, we are using Docker's rootlesskit, to avoid
unnecessary privileges for the dockerized components. This also means
that the user starting up the program does not need root/admin
privileges on the machine running PHAIDRA.

Nevertheless, setting up Docker itself will need a system admin user.
Below we describe the steps that we use for rootless Docker with
privileged ports and (needed for http and https traffic on the
SSL-enabled versions) and client-IP forwarding (needed for restricting
access to parts of the system).

### set up rootlesskit

1.  turn off running privileged docker service

``` example
sudo systemctl disable --now docker.service docker.socket
sudo reboot
```

2.  install uidmap package

    The `uidmap` package is available in both ubuntu and Debian official
    repositories and is needed for Docker's rootlesskit to properly
    function.

``` example
sudo apt install uidmap
```

3.  install rootlesskit

``` example
echo "export DOCKER_HOST=unix:///run/user/$(id -u)/docker.sock" >> ~/.bashrc
echo "export XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/run/user/$(id -u)" >> ~/.bashrc
source ~/.bashrc
dockerd-rootless-setuptool.sh install
# activate autostart of services
sudo loginctl enable-linger $USER
```

4.  change port-forwarding mode for rootlesskit to slirp4netns

    In order to receive the original client IPs accessing the webserver,
    we change the port-forwarding mode of the rootlesskit (the default
    one drops IPs and nginx/apache only receive the docker
    network-bridge address, which does not allow for IP-filtering
    administrative parts of the system as a consequence).

``` example
mkdir -p ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d
echo "[Service]" >> ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/override.conf
echo 'Environment="DOCKERD_ROOTLESS_ROOTLESSKIT_PORT_DRIVER=slirp4netns"' >> ~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/override.conf
systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user restart docker
```

5.  allow privileged ports for slirp4netns

    To allow opening ports 80 and 443 for unprivileged slirp4netns we
    need to dedicately allow it (setcap will not work for this):

``` example
echo "net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start=0" | sudo tee /etc/sysctl.d/99-rootless.conf
sudo sysctl --system
```

6.  add cpuset support

    By default docker cpuset limitations are not enabled for rootless
    configurations (see [upstream documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/security/rootless/#limiting-resources)). One can do the following to change this:

``` example
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice/user@$(id -u).service/cgroup.controllers
cpu memory pids
sudo su -
mkdir -p /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d
cat > /etc/systemd/system/user@.service.d/delegate.conf << EOF
> [Service]
> Delegate=cpu cpuset io memory pids
> EOF
systemctl daemon-reload
exit
cat /sys/fs/cgroup/user.slice/user-$(id -u).slice/user@$(id -u).service/cgroup.controllers
cpuset cpu io memory pids
systemctl --user restart docker
```

7.  activate br_netfilter kernel module
    
    You might run into the issue, that docker version warns about `WARNING: bridge-nf-call-iptables is disabled` and 
    `WARNING: bridge-nf-call-ip6tables is disabled`. You can get rid of this warning by running `sudo modprobe br_netfilter`.
    To make this change persistent on systemd-enabled systems (here tested on Debian-12), you can run the following command:
    ```
    echo "br_netfilter" | sudo tee -a /etc/modules-load.d/br_netfilter.conf
    ```
8. configure prometheus monitorability
   
   To activate the docker metrics endpoint, create the file `~/.config/docker/daemon.json` and add the following (the code below is for a rootless setup, for privileged docker see the [upstream documentation](https://docs.docker.com/config/daemon/prometheus/)):
   
   ```
   {
     "metrics-addr": "0.0.0.0:9323"
   }
   ```
   
   Also, add the following line to `~/.config/systemd/user/docker.service.d/override.conf`:
   
   ```
   Environment=DOCKERD_ROOTLESS_ROOTLESSKIT_FLAGS="-p 0.0.0.0:9323:9323/tcp"
   ```
   
   Then, run the following, to apply the changes:
   
   ```
   systemctl --user daemon-reload
   systemctl --user restart docker.service
   ```
