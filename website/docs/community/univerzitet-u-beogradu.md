The Project should enable the partner universities to realize the complete automation of library information system, which will enable students, teachers and other users of the academic libraries to effectively use and exchange conventional and electronic library materials. The Project importance is increased by the selection of regional network as the fundamental technological and organizational model of the library system. Regional network provides direct flow of scientific information and documents in the region, and that way also effective educational, professional and cultural cooperation among universities in the region.
