# Landesbibliothek Vorarlberg

At the Vorarlberger Landesbibliothek PHAIDRA supports the continuous preservation of Vorarlberg culture. PHAIDRA facilitates long-term preservation of a steadily increasing number of digital objects in addition to accessibility to an international public. For the Vorarlberger Landesbibliothek PHAIDRA will collect digital born documents as well as results of former digitalisation projects. During the pilot phase large picture- and postcard collections will be released, further projects involve a great variety of objects such as maps, e-books, e-journals and newspapers concerning Vorarlberg.
