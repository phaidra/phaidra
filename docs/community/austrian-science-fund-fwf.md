The FWF uses PHAIDRA as a repository for the FWF-E-Book-Library. The FWF-E-Book-Library is an open access repository for all stand-alone publications funded by the FWF. Since December 2011 it is mandatory for both authors and publishers to make stand-alone publications funded by the FWF available on the FWF-E-Book-Library. For those stand-alone-publications funded by the FWF between 2000 and December 2011, this can also be done on a voluntary basis. In line with the FWF's Open Access Policy, the FWF-E-Book-Library supports permanent and free access to scientific publications on the Internet. Additionally, it improves the visibility and dissemination of each publication for both the international scientific community and the general public.
